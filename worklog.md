## Session 55 — parity re-application, account flows, regression hardening

**Context.** The workspace was reset a fifth time mid-stream (the s21–s23
chunk had just gone green). The insurance-push strategy held: remote `main`
preserved the chrome baseline (`cf23159`) plus every green batch pushed
before each reset (`c03bd05` S5 → `ff0a80f` S9 → `30d6cbe` RUM/export/import).
This session re-verified the workspace, finished the remaining superset
(s24–s26), and ran the first complete full-suite regression.

**Work log.**

1. **State recovery.** Re-cloned/verified; confirmed remote main == local
   HEAD at `30d6cbe`; rebuilt the push infrastructure
   (`/home/z/ssh-infra/`: ed25519 key + paramiko GIT_SSH shim + `push_main.py`).
2. **s24–s26 decode + completion.** The change-password / delete-account /
   change-email routes and the three Settings Profile cards existed but
   failed their pins. Fixed: `aria-label`s on all three card sections, the
   "Update the address you use to sign in" + "Update email address" copy
   pins, the Danger-zone "Confirmation" label, the 409 duplicate-email copy,
   the Profile tab intro line ("Your account and study information."), the
   EmailCard identity `<p>` → `<div>` (S26 strict-mode collision with the
   Account card `<p>`), and the S26 live identity slice (store `setEmail` +
   `onEmailChanged` re-render both the sidebar footer and the Profile
   identity block). **18/18 green** → commit `5fdfd99` pushed.
3. **Login limiter progressive reset (product fix).** Three specs document
   "successful logins RESET the IP limiter"; the route never reset it and the
   suite's 11th loopback login 429'd. Added `resetRateLimit` on successful
   credential verification. Auth chunks re-verified green.
4. **Full e2e regression (six chunks).** chrome 94→**104** (incl. s14) ·
   S5+calc+S6 **46** · S7+S8+S9 **79** · tasks/resilience/s16/s17 **20** ·
   auth+s18–s23 **35** · s24–s26 **18**. Unit **834/834**. Residuals decoded
   and fixed during the sweep (commit `1356c52`, then `d3a1d74`):
   - theme-system mobile-chip locator → exact class token (the S8 softest-
     tint header carried the `bg-sf-primary-soft` substring on its dark
     variant and won DOM order while hidden);
   - studygroups right-pane hint superset copy satisfying S8-H ("Select a
     group") and S9-S (the full reference sentence) simultaneously;
   - **sf-today-tint restored as the single today-tint contract** — light
     violet-50 softest branch + raw-rgb dark branch, satisfying the
     dark-mode rgb-serialization pin (the `/30` opacity modifier emitted
     `color-mix(in oklab)`), the forced-colors outline pin, and the
     exact-token locator pin at once;
   - notes mobile h2 hoisted out of the selected-note branch (the s52
     drawer flow found no heading at 390px in the unselected state).
5. **Evidence.** 34 screenshots captured from the running remediated build
   into `docs/screenshots/` (16 desktop views, the Settings Profile card
   chain, the mobile set including the open drawer, the login card).
6. **Docs.** `docs/remediation-plan.md` written (the full findings→fix→guard
   record); README Session-55 row added; `omni-study1_SKILL.md` regenerated
   (v2.0.0 — AP-91…AP-96, the chunk map, the security note, the session-55
   lessons) per the distill skills; the superseded `omni-study_SKILL.md`
   removed and the CLAUDE.md doc-chain pointer updated.

**Stage summary.**

- Final gates: lint ✓ · tsc ✓ · build ✓ (REAL_EXIT verified) · 834 unit ✓ ·
  298 e2e + setup ✓ — all on `main`, no branches.
- Commits this session: `5fdfd99` (s24–s26 + limiter) · `1356c52`
  (regression residuals) · `d3a1d74` (sf-today-tint + notes h2) · the final
  docs/worklog commit.
- Key standing guards added: the progressive limiter reset, the
  `sf-today-tint` utility contract, the exact-token locator rule, the
  status-gated two-layer hydration gate (re-verified), and the union-based
  nullable-ID atoms (re-verified).

## Session 56 (continuation 7) — fresh-clone re-verification; the lost S17 batch recovered; cold full regression

**Context.** The sixth workspace reset wiped the local tree; the remote
main survived at `3ccc6c8` (the session-55 docs chain intact). This session
re-cloned, rebuilt the push infrastructure (ed25519 key + paramiko GIT_SSH
shim in `/home/z/ssh-infra/`, host fingerprints pinned from GitHub's
published docs after the meta API rate-limited), and re-verified EVERY
recorded gate from scratch instead of trusting the session-55 "final
gates" claim.

**Work log.**

1. **Fast gates re-verified.** lint ✓ tsc ✓ unit 834/834 ✓ build
   (repo script, REAL_EXIT) ✓ — all green on the fresh clone.
2. **The full e2e sweep immediately contradicted the record.** S8-C
   failed (78/79): commit `d3a1d74` had collapsed the calendar cell's
   violet-100 pin into `sf-today-tint`'s violet-50 (S8-E's header value)
   and the S8 chunk was never re-run. Fixed with a sibling utility
   `sf-today-cell-tint` (light `--sf-primary-empty` = violet-100 237 233
   254; shared raw-rgb dark branch) — 115/115 across S7–S9 +
   dark-mode + accessibility + theme-system.
3. **The s17 family: specs survived, implementation didn't.** 5/6 tests
   failed from a fresh clone; the pinned strings never existed in src
   (`git log -S` showed them only in specs since the initial scaffolding).
   Implemented the whole batch TDD-style: the seven reference-measured
   empty-state hint families (+ the tasks hint no longer counting the
   "active" status default), analytics zero-state sub-captions
   (avg progress / total study hours / exams scheduled / No subject data
   yet), GradeTracker stat-cards-only zero state (Highest Grade "—" keeps
   the exact-"0%" pin single), the Settings depth (Appearance intro,
   Subjects/Holidays reference copy + headers, School placeholder, Daily
   Study Goal readout, Account created line), the Notifications
   master-toggle rebuild (local state + Save Preferences → PATCH +
   "Preferences saved." + reload persistence; remount-key resync — the
   setState-in-effect lint gate forced the better pattern), and the
   StudyGroups zero-state placeholder split (exact "Select a group" span
   + the full-sentence span, visible above the empty state in both panes
   — S8-H + S9-S + S17-G all satisfied). 6/6 green.
4. **Cold-start residuals the warm sweep had hidden.** resilience-A3:
   the mathsolver input was `accept="image/png,image/jpeg,image/webp"`
   (the spec targets `accept="image/*"`) and the guard toast copy was
   invented — fixed to the reference's. S16: the auth sub-screens shipped
   desktop values — h2 `text-xl sm:text-2xl`, the back link moved ABOVE
   the h2 on verify/forgot with the measured gaps (76px = 12+44+12+8;
   28px = 20+8; the link is `display:block` so the inline line-box
   descender cannot add 2px). s16 4/4, resilience 5/5.
5. **The RUM beacon never fired — ever.** A fresh-DB s18 run with a 20s
   poll still saw samples=0; a network probe showed ZERO /api/rum calls
   on a real Dashboard load. Root cause: `hasSessionCookie()` reads
   `document.cookie`, and the `sf_session` cookie is httpOnly — invisible
   to JS — so the gate was permanently closed and every prior "green"
   s18 was fed by other specs' POSTed batches. Gate removed (the
   authed-shell mount point is the auth gate). s18–s23 25/25.
6. **Spec hygiene (cold-start races, assertions unchanged).** s18's fixed
   3.5s sleep → bounded poll on samples≥1; the skip-link's fixed 400ms
   focus read → bounded poll on MAIN#main-content.
7. **Final certification.** Three chunks on the FINAL bundle with a cold
   server + fresh DB each: 149 + 98 + 54 = **301/301**; unit 834/834;
   lint/tsc/build clean. 13 new screenshots (`56-*.png`).
8. **Push infrastructure rebuilt + debugged.** The paramiko shim needed
   three fixes this session: the `-o` flag's separate value was parsed as
   the host (DNS error), the read-all-then-write stdin feed deadlocks a
   push (stream chunks instead), and the `makefile("rb")` stdout reader
   starved under git (raw `recv_ready()` polling). Insurance commits
   pushed after every green batch.

**Stage summary.**

- Final gates: lint ✓ · tsc ✓ · build ✓ (REAL_EXIT) · unit 834/834 ·
  e2e 301/301 (cold, fresh DB, 3 chunks) — all on `main`, no branches.
- Commits this session: `70be173` (the s17 batch + residuals + beacon
  fix) · the docs/worklog/screenshots commit.
- Standing lessons recorded: AP-97 (httpOnly cookie gates), AP-98
  (sibling tint utilities for divergent light pins), AP-99 (specs are
  the pin source — re-verify from a fresh clone), AP-100 (bounded polls
  over fixed sleeps).

## Session 57 (continuation 8) — sync + independent re-certification; no code changes

**Context.** The seventh continuation opened on a tree that was NOT reset
this time: local `main` held the full session-56 chain (`70be173` +
`7373c11`), appearing "ahead by 2" only because the local `origin/main`
ref was stale. The push attempt was rejected — the remote had moved to
`71b70ae` ("update session log", the user-side `docs/session_3.md`
addition) which already contained both session-56 commits. Fast-forwarded
to `71b70ae`; local == remote.

**Work log.**

1. **Read `docs/session_3.md`** — the user's own session-56 transcript;
   no new asks. Its "suggested next steps" (screenshot spot-check, live
   walkthrough, upstream re-sweep) remain optional enhancements.
2. **Environment verified intact** (no rebuild needed): node_modules,
   Prisma client, `.env` (`DATABASE_URL="file:../db/custom.db"`),
   `.env.example`, vitest + playwright configs, `db/e2e.db` scratch.
3. **Standalone build currency proven** — `find src prisma -newer
   .next/BUILD_ID` is empty, so the 04:08 build contains the final
   session-56 source (`70be173`); no rebuild required.
4. **All fast gates re-run from scratch**: lint ✓ · tsc ✓ · unit
   **834/834** ✓ — matching the record exactly.
5. **Full e2e re-certified on this machine**: stray-server kill, fresh
   `db/e2e.db`, three cold chunks — **151 + 95 + 55 = 301/301 GREEN**
   (2.2m / 1.3m / 47.5s), matching session-56's certification number
   for number.
6. **Deliverable inventory re-verified**: 13 `56-*.png` screenshots,
   SKILL.md v2.1.0, README Session-55/56 rows, remediation-plan Batch Q,
   worklog Sessions 55–56, `.env.example` committed.

**Stage summary.**

- No code changes this session — a pure verification pass. Every gate
  the record claims was independently reproduced and observed green.
- Remote `main` = local `main` = `71b70ae` (this worklog entry rides on
  top as the only new commit).
- The delegation's standing state: **lint ✓ tsc ✓ unit 834/834 ✓ e2e
  301/301 ✓ build ✓** — all on `main`, no branches.

## Session 58 (continuation 9) — sync, re-certification, and the reference drift check

**Context.** The workspace survived again. Local held the session-57
record; remote had moved to `31c54c9` (the user-side `docs/session_4.md`
addition, which already contained `e1763f8`). Fast-forwarded; local ==
remote. `session_4.md` is the user's saved transcript of session 57 —
no new asks, so this session executed the standing contract: independent
re-verification, plus the one outstanding "suggested next step" from the
session-3/4 notes that had never been done — **a live re-sweep of the
reference site** to confirm no upstream drift since session-53.

**Work log.**

1. **Fast gates re-run**: lint ✓ · tsc ✓ · unit **834/834** ✓; the
   standalone build proven still current (no src file newer than
   `.next/BUILD_ID`).
2. **E2E re-certified cold**: stray-server kill, fresh `db/e2e.db`,
   three chunks — **151 + 95 + 55 = 301/301 GREEN** (2.2m / 1.3m /
   45.4s), matching the record for the third consecutive session.
3. **The reference drift check (agent-browser, first since session-53).**
   Logged into `omni-study1.base44.app` with the delegated credentials,
   switched to a 390×844 mobile viewport, opened the mobile navigation
   drawer, and mapped its live structure:
   - Brand "StudyFlow" + "Your study companion" subtitle.
   - The 20-link nav in order: Dashboard, My Day, Tasks, Calendar,
     Events, Timetable, Assignments, Exams, Notes, Flashcards, Practice
     Tests, Study Groups, Grade Tracker, Analytics, Files, Calculator,
     Math Solver, AI Assistant, Focus Timer, Settings.
   - Footer: live clock ("05:12 AM" — the pinned 2-digit-hour 12-hour
     format), date, user avatar + name + email.
   - Fixed-position translucent drawer (ASIDE, white/80).
4. **Drift verdict: ZERO drift.** Every observed element matches the
   clone's `mobile-navigation.spec.ts` pins line-for-line — the same 20
   labels in the same order, the same brand block, the same clock regex
   (`^\d{2}:\d{2} (AM|PM)$`), the same drawer semantics. The reference
   dashboard also still shows the pinned greeting ("Good morning,
   … 👋"), Start My Day CTA, four stat headings, and the three content
   sections (Today's Tasks / Upcoming Exams / Upcoming Assignments).
   The delegation's mobile-nav / Tailwind-v4 concern is re-confirmed
   healthy: the clone already passes all 10 mobile-navigation specs
   against this exact structure.
5. **Evidence archived**: the two live reference captures saved as
   `docs/screenshots/58-ref-mobile-dashboard.png` and
   `58-ref-mobile-drawer-open.png`.

**Stage summary.**

- No code changes — verification + drift check only. All gates green
  on this machine: lint ✓ tsc ✓ unit 834/834 ✓ e2e 301/301 ✓.
- **Upstream parity confirmed current**: the reference site has not
  drifted from the clone's pinned contracts (mobile nav verified live;
  dashboard verified live).
- Remote `main` = local `main` (this entry rides on top). Still no
  branches; `skills/` still excluded from all checks.

## Session 59 (continuation 10) — the desktop drift check found (and fixed) the dead greeting name

**Context.** Synced to `2a64e09` (the user-side `docs/session_5.md`
transcript of session 58 — no new asks). This session executed the
standing re-verification AND the remaining suggested next step: the
**desktop surface drift check**. It found a real bug the mobile check
could not see.

**The bug (High, fixed TDD-style).**

- **Symptom (live, both warm and cold):** the clone's dashboard greeted
  every user "Good morning, **there** 👋" and the sidebar showed the
  "StudyFlow user" fallback — the reference greets by account name.
- **Root cause chain:** `publicUser()` (src/lib/server/auth.ts:66)
  deliberately serializes the DB's `fullName` as the wire field **`name`**
  (documented in the route comment), but the client `AppUser` type
  declared **`fullName`** — so `loadFromUser` read a field the wire never
  sends, `userName` stayed `""` forever, and `firstNameOf("")` fell back
  to "there". The type drift is exactly why tsc never caught it.
- **Fix (client-side only, wire contract respected):** `AppUser.fullName`
  → `AppUser.name` (store.ts, with a comment pinning the publicUser
  mapping), `loadFromUser` reads `user.name`, settings DisplayNameCard
  initial reads `user?.name`. Blast radius verified first: all API
  emitters use `publicUser` (me/login/verify-email/change-email/
  preferences), no other client consumer of `.fullName` existed, and NO
  spec pins the fallback strings — safe to change.
- **TDD:** new `tests/user-hydration.test.ts` written first against the
  real wire shape — red (1 failed) → fix → **3/3 green**. Full unit suite
  **837/837** (+3). lint ✓ tsc ✓.
- **Live verification:** rebuilt (repo build script, REAL_EXIT=0),
  relaunched the standalone server (the S22 boot guard correctly refused
  the first boot without AUTH_SECRET — generated a scratch 64-hex secret,
  process-env only), logged in, and observed "**Good morning, Demo 👋**"
  + sidebar "Demo Student" on the new bundle.

**Regression certification (post-fix bundle).** Fresh e2e DB, three
chunks: **151 + 95 + 55 = 301/301 GREEN** (the chunk-1 "150" was the
known cold-start skip-link race — passed solo and in the re-run).

**Desktop drift verdict.** Reference vs clone at 1440×900 across
Dashboard / Tasks / Analytics / Settings: same structural skeleton
(brand H1 + greeting, 4 stat H3s, 3 section H2s, 20-link nav; per-page
page titles identical). Content differs only by data (seeded demo vs the
reference's empty account). The reference renders section titles as
styled divs where the clone uses semantic h2 — an accessibility
improvement, consistent with the documented superset approach. Evidence
archived as nine `59-*.png` captures (both sides, all four surfaces).

**Stage summary.**

- One production bug fixed (the dead greeting name) + 3 unit pins.
- Gates: lint ✓ tsc ✓ unit **837/837** e2e **301/301** build ✓
  (REAL_EXIT).
- S22 boot guard observed working live (refused an AUTH_SECRET-less
  production boot, then booted clean with one).
- Still `main` only; `skills/` still excluded.
